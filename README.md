# Exp - 3 RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:
To study the problem statement and SRS of a Railway Management System and represent its system architecture using UML diagrams.

# SRS (Procedure):
```
Analyze the Railway Management System and model its components through the following UML diagrams:

1.Use Case Diagram – Identifies actors (e.g., Passenger, Admin) and system functionalities (e.g., Book Ticket, Cancel Ticket, Check Schedule).
2.Class Diagram – Represents system classes such as Train, Ticket, Passenger, and their relationships.
3.Activity Diagram – Describes workflows such as booking and cancellation of tickets.
4.Sequence Diagram – Illustrates object interactions in time sequence during operations like booking a ticket.
5.Communication Diagram – Highlights interactions between system components such as Passenger, Ticketing System, and Admin.
6.Package Diagram – Organizes components into logical modules like User Interface, Ticketing Module, and Schedule Management.
